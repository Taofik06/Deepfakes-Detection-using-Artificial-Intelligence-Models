# Deepfakes-Detection-using-Artificial-Intelligence-Models
This research aims to address the potential misuse of manipulated media, particularly in the form of deceptive photos, by developing a machine learning model capable of detecting deepfakes in photos using a hybrid machine learning model.
To achieve this aim, several objectives have been defined, such as conducting a comprehensive literature review and gathering a diverse and extensive dataset of both genuine and deepfake photos. This dataset will include photographs that are both real and deep fake, covering a wide spectrum of deep fake variants and traits. The goal of this research is to create a deepfake detection algorithm that is reliable and accurate for photographs, particularly designed to guard against hazards and harmful actions made possible by altered images.
